**Final Answer**: A. Collaborative

------------------
To determine the final task goal of the people in the video, let's analyze the sequence of events and their actions step by step:

1. **Initial Actions:**
   - The players start by collecting materials, specifically wood.
   - They mention needing to get started with materials and find wood.

2. **Crafting Activities:**
   - They craft oak planks from the collected oak logs.
   - A crafting table is crafted and placed.
   - The focus then shifts to crafting oak doors.

3. **Door Crafting:**
   - Multiple oak doors are crafted (3 oak doors, then 6 oak doors).
   - The players express readiness to place the doors.

4. **Placement of Doors:**
   - One of the players (Jack) places an oak door at a specific coordinate.

5. **Contextual Clues:**
   - The repeated emphasis on crafting and placing doors suggests that the doors are a significant part of their goal.
   - There is no explicit mention of building a complete house or other large structures beyond the doors.

Given these observations, the most logical conclusion is that the final task goal of the people in the video is:

**A. Craft and place 3 doors**

This option aligns best with the detailed focus on crafting and placing doors throughout the video. While they do collect logs and create a crafting table, these activities are means to achieve the primary goal of crafting and placing doors. Building a house (option B) is not explicitly mentioned as a goal, and although they do collect logs and create a crafting table (option C), this is a preparatory step rather than the final goal.

Therefore, the final answer is **A. Craft and place 3 doors**.

------------------
Based on the sequence of events in the provided images and the dialogue, it appears that **Jack** is the one who crafted the first door. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Resource Gathering**: Jack starts by gathering materials and crafting planks.
2. **Crafting Table**: Jack crafts a crafting table.
3. **Door Crafting**: Jack explicitly states, "Looks like I've got all the materials! Let me craft the door now!" and then successfully crafts the oak door.
4. **Placement of the Door**: Jack places the crafted oak door.

Given these steps, it is clear that Jack is the one who crafted the first door.

Therefore, the answer is **A. Jack**.

------------------
Based on the sequence of events in the video, let's analyze what Jack did step by step:

1. **Initial Actions**: Jack started by collecting materials, specifically oak logs, which he converted into oak planks.
2. **Crafting Oak Doors**: With the oak planks, Jack crafted oak doors. The chat messages indicate that he successfully crafted 6 oak doors.
3. **Placing the Doors**: After crafting the doors, Jack proceeded to place one of the doors at a specific location.

Given these steps, the most accurate option is:

**C. Craft 6 doors**

Jack crafted 6 doors as indicated by the chat messages in the video. Therefore, the correct answer is **C. Craft 6 doors**.

------------------
To determine what Jane did in the video, let's analyze the sequence of events and the actions of each character:

1. **Initial Setup and Resource Gathering:**

   - Jack crafts oak planks and a crafting table.

2. **Jane's Actions:**
   - Jane joins the game.
   - Jane makes several comments about random facts (e.g., throwing an item at a cactus, shearing a snow golem, making a chicken wear a pumpkin).
   - These comments do not directly relate to any specific action or task in the game.

3. **Door Crafting:**
   - Jack crafts oak doors.
   - Jack places an oak door.

4. **Jane's Impact:**
   - Jane's comments are unrelated to the actual tasks being performed (crafting and placing doors).
   - There is no indication that Jane crafted a birch door or an oak door.
   - Jane's comments seem to be distractions rather than contributions to the task.

Given this analysis, the most accurate conclusion is that Jane did not craft a birch door or an oak door. Instead, her actions were limited to making distracting comments.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C. Disturb the task**

------------------

5. **Gathering More Resources**: John gathers more oak planks to meet the requirement for crafting a door.
6. **Successfully Crafting a Door**: After obtaining the required oak planks, John successfully crafts an oak door.

Given these steps, the most accurate action that John performed is:

**C. Craft a door**

John initially tried to craft a door but didn't have enough resources. After gathering more oak planks, he successfully crafted an oak door. Therefore, the correct answer is:
