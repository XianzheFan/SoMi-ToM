A. Jack currently has 12 oak planks.
-------------------------
Based on the dialogue history and the images provided, Jane currently has 12 oak planks and a crafting table. Jack has 3 oak planks and no chests. John has also collected 3 oak logs.

-------------------------
Based on the dialogue history and the image provided, it seems that Jack has collected 3 oak logs and crafted 3 oak planks. John has also collected 5 oak logs. Jane has not collected any logs yet.

To craft the chests, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Jane needs to collect at least 3 oak logs or spruce logs or birch logs.
2. Once Jane has the logs, she can convert them into planks using the command !craftRecipe("oak_planks", 4) or !craftRecipe("spruce_planks", 4) or !craftRecipe("birch_planks", 4). This will produce 16 planks. Note that 1 log is consumed for every 4 planks produced.
3. After crafting the planks, Jane can use the planks to craft a crafting table using the command !craftRecipe("crafting_table", 1). This will consume 4 planks.
4. Once Jane has a crafting table, she can use it to craft the chests using the command !craftRecipe("chest", 1). This will consume 8 planks.
5. Finally, Jane can use the command !placeHere("chest") to place the chest.
